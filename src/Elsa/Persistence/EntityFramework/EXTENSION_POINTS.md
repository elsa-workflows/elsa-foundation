# Extension points — Persistence.EntityFramework (policy)

Shared policy helpers for first-party EF Core persistence under accepted
[ADR 0073](../../../../docs/adr/0073-ef-core-is-the-only-first-party-persistence-family.md).
This package does not own domain entities or a mandated `DbContext` base.

## Replacement / composition

There is no replacement contract in this package. Modules own derived `DbContext` types.
Hosts register the derived context that matches the selected relational provider and call
`EfDatabaseMigrator.ApplyAsync` with that provider's expected `Database.ProviderName`.

## Apply policy

`EfMigratePolicy.AutoMigrate` runs `Database.MigrateAsync` (EF 9+ lock).
`EfMigratePolicy.Validate` refuses to start when pending migrations exist.
Secrets registers that apply on both `IHostedService` and CShells `IShellInitializer`
so a feature enable or reload uses the same policy as a cold start.

## Shared transactions

`EfSharedTransaction` is the owner a cross-module write uses when several module contexts must commit
as one unit. It constructs fresh instances of the configured contexts, shares one connection and one
transaction between them, commits or rolls back once, and refuses contexts that name different providers
or connection strings. Module atomic writers join it through their transaction-factory seam
(`EfSharedTransaction.BeginOperationAsync`); a writer that rolls back makes the owner rollback-only.
