# Extension points — Workflows.Runtime domain

The per-domain catalog (framework §2.22.1). Anchored at `Elsa.Workflows.Runtime.Core` — this is the only project in this domain (no separate feature project); defaults for `ISignalHandler` and `IActivityCompletionHandler` are provided by `ActivityBase` in this Core. No published events in this domain.

## Implementable contributor interfaces

### `ISignalHandler` *(Core — `Elsa.Workflows.Runtime.Core`)*
- **Kind:** Contributor (receives a signal and acts — push pattern).
- **Signature:** `ValueTask ReceiveSignalAsync(object signal, SignalContext context);`
- **Usage:** implement on activity classes to receive signals sent to the workflow. `ActivityBase` exposes `ReceiveSignalAsync` which dispatches to the activity's `ISignalHandler` implementation.
- **Not a fan-in aggregator** — each activity implements this directly; there is no aggregating event handler. Signals are dispatched to activities in the workflow graph, not via the DI container.
- **Sub-interface:** `IBehavior : ISignalHandler` — for behaviour objects composable onto activities.

**Known implementations (shipped):**
- Activity classes that override `ReceiveSignalAsync` in the codebase.

### `IActivityCompletionHandler` *(Core — `Elsa.Workflows.Runtime.Core`)*
- **Kind:** Overridable single-impl (one handler expected at a time, injected by DI).
- **Signature:** `CompleteActivityAsync(IActivityExecutionContext context)`, `CompleteActivityAsync(IActivityExecutionContext context, object result)`, `CompleteActivityAsync(IActivityExecutionContext context, IEnumerable<string> outcomes)`, `CompleteActivityAsync(IActivityExecutionContext context, object result, IEnumerable<string> outcomes)`.
- **Register:** `services.Replace(ServiceDescriptor.Scoped<IActivityCompletionHandler, MyHandler>())` — single-impl; a replacement steps aside the previous one.
- **Consumed by:** `ActivityBase.CompleteAsync` — resolves `IActivityCompletionHandler` from the execution context's service provider.

**Known implementations (shipped):**
- `Elsa.Workflows.Runtime.JavaScript` — `ActivityCompletionHandler` *(cross-domain — test implementation for JS-context activity completion)*
