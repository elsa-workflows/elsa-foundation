The focused evidence covers exact per-expression-type provider routing, JavaScript runtime globals, Liquid symbols, dotted/nested value shapes, authoritative persisted context, policy filtering before paging, host-replaceable authorization and revision fingerprints, descriptor/capability composition, semantic validation state mapping (including validator faults and caller cancellation), publication fail-closed behavior, and Test Run acknowledgement/metadata.

## Full architecture suite

The complete `Elsa.Architecture.Tests` run passes all 320 tests.

The three custom-host composition failures initially exposed by this run were corrected by making the persisted authoring-context source safely optional when a host omits draft persistence. All affected composition tests now pass.

## Contract audit

- Context and symbols are server-authoritative, permission/host-policy filtered, metadata-only, bounded, and `no-store`; hosts can replace `IExpressionAuthoringAuthorizationPolicy`, and its opaque revision participates in stale-result protection.
- Catalog paging occurs after filtering.
- Value-shape members are inlined to depth four; lazy retrieval is explicitly unsupported by v1 descriptors.
- JavaScript, Liquid, and future providers own their own globals/functions/variables; there is no generic “Elsa globals” catalog.
- Known validation errors gate Test Run/publication; unavailable Test Run validation supports explicit acknowledgement only when the result contains no error diagnostics; publication remains fail-closed.
